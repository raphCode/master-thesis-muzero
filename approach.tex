\chapter{Approach/Implementation}
\label{approach}
% Hier beschreibst du, was du in der Arbeit neues gemacht hast, und wie du es
% implementiert hast.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Components / Frameworks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item PyTorch
        \question{jax also looks cool:
        \url{https://deepmind.com/blog/article/using-jax-to-accelerate-our-research}}
        \item Ray (multiprocessing, option for distributed computing) \cite{ray}
        \item Hydra (configuration) \cite{hydra}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Features:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item modular, game-agnostic code
        \item maybe self consistency training \cite{efficientzero}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Experimental:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item make non-sequential games work (being "blind" in the search tree /
        while learning until all players made their move)
        \item is the MCTS visit count really a good indicator for the
        best move?
        \todo{Check if the value estimation is incorporated in creating a good
        visit count distribution via UCB}
        See also \citetitle{alphazero_issues}, \citetitle{mcts_po}
        \item value target is often noisy, estimate and learn its variance too and use it
        in the tree search metric to avoid "risky" situations?
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
