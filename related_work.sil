While no multiplayer version for MuZero itself exists, \citeauthor{multiplayer_alphazero}
extended the predecessor algorithm AlphaZero to multiplayer
capabilities\cite{multiplayer_alphazero}.

Importantly, they relax the assumption of the game being zero-sum:
A zero-sum game involves two players where player one's gain comes with an equivalent loss
for the other player.
The AlphaZero (and in turn MuZero) algorithm make use of this fact by directly predicting
how good the current position is for the current player by a scalar \term{value} output of
the network\cite{alphazero}\cite{muzero}.
The multiplayer extension predicts a \term{value vector} instead, which provides an
estimate of the expected utility of the state for each player independently.

Likewise, they also extend the game to return scores for each player at the end instead of
a single outcome.
Naturally, the algorithm rotates over the list of all players instead of alternating
between two players.\cite{alphazero}
They evaluate their work on multiplayer versions of Connect 4 and Tic-Tac-Toe:
The network learns to encode knowledge of the game into search, indicating that the
proposed multiplayer strategy works in principle.
Performance-wise the algorithm places itself below human experts.
