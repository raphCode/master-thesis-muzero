# Typst Code for my Master's Thesis

**Deep Reinforcement Learning with MuZero:
Theoretical Foundations, Variants, and Implementation
for a Collaborative Game**

Here are the Typst sources for the presentation slides ([slides.typ](slides.typ)) and the
thesis main document ([main.typ](main.typ)).

The Typst compiler v0.8.0 is necessary to compile the documents.

For the final compiled PDF document and presentation slides, as well as information on
other branches in this repo, see the [main branch](../../tree/main/).
